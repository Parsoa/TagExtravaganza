# How should I capitalize album titles and band names?

Please use the following standard guidelines for capitalizing artist names, record labels, album and song titles in the English language. Other rules may apply to other languages.

All titles should be in standard mixed case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized and followed by lower case letters, as noted below:

Capitalize all nouns, verbs (including be, been, am, are, is, was, and were), adverbs, subordinating conjunctions (including if and as when it is not used as a preposition), adjectives (including so when used as an adjective), and pronouns (including he, she, we, and it). Examples:
Love Is in the Air
I Am the Walrus
That Was Then, This Is Now
You Are So Beautiful
This Is As Good As It Gets

## Do not capitalize:
a. Articles: a, an, the (unless part of an artist's name)

The Man Who Sold the World
In a Safe Place
The Best of The Temptations

b. Coordinating conjunctions: and, but, or, nor, for, yet, and so

Rattle and Hum
It's Now or Never
Nothin' but a Good Time

Special Notes: The word "but" can function as either a conjunction, preposition, or an adverb. Most of the time, it functions as a conjunction or a preposition and should be lowercase. Much less frequently, it will function as an adverb, and should be capitalized. In that case, the word "but" will immediately follow a verb (without a comma), and can be replaced by other adverbs like "only" or "just" (without changing anything else or adding punctuation) and will convey the same message:

Life Is But a Dream
Ain't But a Few of Us Left
You Are But a Draft, a Long Rehearsal for a Show That Will Never Play
If the word "but" is better replaced by the word "except", or if it is used in a phrase that contradicts the first half of the sentence, it is not an adverb and should be lowercase.
I Know You Are but What Am I
I Don't Know What It Is but I Like It

c. Short prepositions: as, at, by, for, in, of, on, to, from

Live at Woodstock
Face to Face
Death Cab for Cutie
Pretty in Pink
Come in from the Cold

Special Note: The word "versus" (and its abbreviated form "vs." or "v.") is commonly left in lower case, despite its being a preposition of more than three characters.

Spy vs. Spy
Birds v. Worms
Special Note: The word "etcetera" (and its abbreviated form "etc.") is also commonly left in lower case when used to represent the phrase "and so on" or "and so forth".
Time After Time etc.
d. When used to form an infinitive: to
Nowhere to Run
How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb
Song I Love to Sing
Reality Used to Be a Friend of Mine

If a title is broken up by major punctuation (colon, question mark, exclamation mark, em-dash, parentheses, or quotes), treat each distinct piece of the title as a whole, and always capitalize the first and last words of each division.
Otis! The Definitive Otis Redding
In Time: The Best of R.E.M.
I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock 'n' Roll Band)

In compounds formed by hyphens, capitalize each part except where the part would not be capitalized if it were a separate word.
The Go-Gos
At the Drive-In
The Boy With the X-Ray Eyes

Only use all caps for acronyms or abbreviations where common use is all caps.
R.E.M.
N.W.A.
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.

Capitalize contractions and slang consistent with the rules above to the extent that such clearly apply. For example, do not capitalize o' for "of", or n' for "and", etc.
Rock 'n' Roll
Will o' the Wisp
Sweet Child o' Mine

Proper nouns should always be capitalized appropriately. This includes parts of band names separated by the word 'and' (for example) where the two parts could stand alone, grammatically.
Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds
Elvis Costello and The Attractions
Huey Lewis and The News

Always capitalize the first and last word of a title, even if it would otherwise be lowercase. Examples:
Bring it On
One Is For
And You and I
The Greatest Hits Of
[edit] Exceptions

In the case where an artist uses a nonstandard capitalization with an artistic intent, the original capitalization used by the artist should be preserved. Examples include k.d. lang (artist), Yellow mY skYcaptain (release), and "tourette's" - track 11 on the release In Utero.

Note that there are cases in which the name of an artist or album - or an entire tracklisting - is written entirely in uppercase or lowercase in the art which accompanies a release. These instances do not qualify as an exception, because they do not represent artistic intent regarding capitalization (in most cases, they are written in this manner for aesthetic purposes related to the cover art).
